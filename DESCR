Ikiwiki is a wiki compiler. It converts wiki pages into HTML pages
suitable for publishing on a website. Unlike many wikis, ikiwiki
does not have its own ad hoc means of storing page history, instead
using a revision control system such as Subversion or Git. This
means that in addition to the usual web interface, you can edit
wiki sources in your favorite editor. There are many other features,
including support for blogging, as well as a large array of plugins.
