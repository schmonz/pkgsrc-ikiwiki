# TODO

- Fix `ikiwiki-mass-rebuild` to work for users without shells
- And then run `ikiwiki-mass-rebuild` on `pkg_install`
- And the `su` portability mess -- just make it require `sudo`

format plugin doesn't play well with Textile -- other formats?

- set up `sudo` privileges for anyone to run `ikiwiki-update-wikilist` as root
